        <ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>CSV files containing data about famous paintings, artists, and museums are uploaded to SQL server using SQL Alchemy in Python. Queries are then performed in SQL Server to analyse museum information.</li>
			<li>The data is initially explored in Excel, where it is found that the opening and closing times in the museum_hours CSV file is formatted incorrectly. Power Query is utilised to convert these columns into appropriate time formats so they can be recognised by SQL. Using Power Query means that the formatting can be applied automatically to any new data introduced.</li>
			<li>In Python, a connection to an SQL Server database is established using SQLAlchemy. The script iterates over a dictionary of the eight CSV files and their corresponding table names, reading each file into a Pandas DataFrame and uploading the data into the specified SQL tables. This Python script demonstrates the ease of moving data from CSV files into an SQL database.</li>
			<li>In SQL Server, queries are performed to find museum details, museums open on certain days, and the museum with the longest opening hours.</li>
            <li>Subqueries and stored procedures are utilised to improve the efficiency of the queries.</li>

        <ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>Python is used to create three ML models: ANN, LSTM, and XGBoost, to predict wheat yields in five Australian states using yearly environmental data.</li>
			<li>CSV files are loaded into Pandas DataFrames, merged and cleaned. Summary statistics are produced, and wheat yields are plotted over time. Correlation matrices and heatmaps used to understand relationships.</li>
			<li>One-hot encoding is applied to 'Region' column, features are scaled using Min-Max scaling, and data is split into training and test sets based on a fixed year.</li>
			<li>Feed-forward ANN is constructed and trained using Keras, experimenting with hidden layers, units, l2 regularisation, and dropout for optimal results.</li>
			<li>LSTM model constructed and trained with manual hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.</li>
			<li>XGBoost model is built with grid search and cross-validation for optimal hyperparameters, providing feature importance to overcome ML black-box problem.</li>

        <a href="https://github.com/c-pullon/web_scraping_ML" target= "_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/logos5.png" alt="" /></a>
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>Data collection: Utilised Python's BeautifulSoup library for web scraping, extracting information on the top 50 companies by revenue from a Wikipedia page. This involved sending a GET request to the URL, parsing the HTML content, and extracting the desired table.</li>
			<li>Data preprocessing: Employed various data preprocessing techniques in Python with Pandas, including data type conversion, formatting adjustments, handling missing values, and column renaming.</li>
			<li>Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA using seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visualise data distributions and explore relationships between variables. Utilised histograms to visualise numeric variable relationships and scatter plots to analyse the correlation between revenue and profit.</li>
			<li>Model development and evaluation: Implemented three machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost—to predict company ownership status based on financial data features. Models were trained and evaluated using accuracy as the primary performance metric. Additionally, employed grid search hyperparameter tuning with XGBoost to optimise model performance.</li>

        <ul style="text-align: left;">
			<li>In this project I used an Excel workbook with three sheets containing data about customers, orders and products of a coffee company to create an interactive dashboard of coffee sales.</li>
			<li>I first joined relevant columns from the three sheets into one table by using X-LOOKUP and index matching. I then created new columns using nested IF statements, and used number and date formatting to make existing columns clearer.</li>
            <li>I checked the resulting table for duplicates before creating pivot tables on key metrics including sales by coffee type over time, total sales by country, and top spending customers. Using these pivot tables I created line graphs, bar charts and column charts to highlight this information.</li>
            <li>Finally, I made a timeline and multiple slicers to alter the visualisations based on the date and other factors. All of these elements were brought together to make a clear, intuitive dashboard to highlight key information for stakeholders.</li>
